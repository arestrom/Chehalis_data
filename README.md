# Chehalis Data

## Overview

An experimental subset version of the Salmon Data shiny application to
allow CRUD operations on a local copy of the Spawning Ground (SG)
database. This application uses a sqlite backend instead of the
postgresql. The application is intended to serve a template for creating
one-off standalone front-ends for individual groups needing customized
access to the database. Hopefully, any applications stemming from this
effort can serve as a simple bridge for biologists to gain access to our
central database until a standardized nodejs angular solution is
implemented.
