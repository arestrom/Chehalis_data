# Chehalis Data

## Overview

An experimental subset version of the Salmon Data shiny application to allow CRUD operations on a local copy of the Spawning Ground (SG) database. 
This application uses a sqlite backend instead of postgresql. The application is intended to serve a template for creating one-off standalone front-ends for individual groups needing customized access to the database. Hopefully, any applications stemming from this effort can serve as a simple bridge for biologists to gain access to our central database until a standardized nodejs angular solution is implemented.
